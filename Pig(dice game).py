#Pig(dice game)
'''
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until the chosen number is 1.

If the player rolls the number 1 at the beginning of the game, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player rolls number 1, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
